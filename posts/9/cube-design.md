# Cube Design

You will be creating a box; the box will have 6 sides and each side musch represent a different perspective, but the entire box must tell a story about family and/or _tradition_.

- Three sides much include nature in some form.
- Three sides much include a tactile element.
- Plan out what you will do for each side, you can use photos for 3 sides but the photos must be clear and be altered in some way.
- Each box will be seen in diamond format. It will be hung from wire.

I choose the tradition of Bodwell, and the theme of this cube is that Bowell is a place whre students can improve their English Skills and experience divers things in the world by providing an effective English-speaking environment.

For each side, I planned...

1. Nation People - 1-point perspective
2. Place of Bodwell - 2-point perspective
3. Midterm and Final - 3-point perspective
4. Bodwell Olympic - disorienting perspective
5. Activities - disorienting perspective
6. College - 2-point perspective

## Questions

---

1. Describe how you will incorporate nature into the three sides

I will incorporate nature into the first, second and fifth sides by adding the elements of nature, such as trees, grasses, water or sun, and real materials. For example, if there are trees there, then I wil lpu tht eleaves of the tree onto the design to incorporate nature.

2. Describe how three sides will use a tactile elements

As you can see of the prious question, I will make tactile elements with nature. To give the main points of this cube, I want to use tactile elemtns to the focused object for three sides. For example, the focused object might be the overwhelming papers, which are in the third side.

3. How will all six sides tell a story about tradition? How are they interconnected? How will one box lead to another?

Basically, its theme is "Bodwell is a place where students can improve their English Skills and experience diverse things in the world by providing an effective English-speaking environment." So, what story I want to convey is that Bodwell is a good place and environment to experience the worlds and practice English. Throughout these six sides, I keep telling the adventages that you can take if you were here, such as Activities, College, Test, or an environment.
