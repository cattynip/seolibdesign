# Linear Perspective

Linear Perspective is one of the art techniques to make distance and depth between the objects in a painting. In this activity, Mr. Gun made us answer the provided questions about the specific painting and the Linear Perspective. Let's see how I answered for them.

1. What objects are depicted in this paiting?

The objects depicted in this paiting are waved clocks, an octopus, a clock-shaped orange ruby, a tree where a clock is hung, a bright-orange box, a huge mirror, a sea, and a mountain. Of course, the ground that all elements are on and the sky are also included in what is depicted.

2. What is the relationship between the objects in the painting?

So many unrelated things are on the ground: curved clocks, a white octopus, and an orange box. However, all three things can be related to each other throughout the existence of Clocks. The silver-framed clock covers the octopus, the tree is hanging the clock, and the golden-framed clock is falling form the top of the orange box. The artist might have wanted to convey that something is connected between them. As much as the artist described this painting philosophically, it is hard to guess their relationship.

3. How does Dali use linear perspective to create a sense of depth and space?

Basically, to use linear perspective, we have to make a horizon, a point on the horizone, and lines from the point, so the objects on the draawing are distorted to the point. This is the traditional way to use linear perspective. However, Dali used the other way to produce the depth and distance on a surface. He just controlled the size of the objects. For example, he drew a tree very big and a mountain very tiny, so he made this image produce the distance between them. So he did not use the traditional method to create a sense of depth and space, but he created the distance between the objects, using different ways.

4. How does the use of linear perspective contribute to the overall message or meaning of the painting?

As I said in th eprevious question, he used different ways to create distance and depth. So, his unique use of linear perspective has been contributing to the painting by adding chaos and creating synthetic awkwardness overall on this painting. Meaning the use of his unique technique to create distance succesfully approached his goal of this painting.

5. What emotions do you feel when you look at this painting?

STRANGENESS. Becasue I needed help understanding and recognizing most of the objects described in this painting. This emotion gets bigger as I see objects I have never seen, such as the clock-shaped orange ruby or the octopus. However, it is not wrong. I firmly believe that it is exactly what the artist wanted the readers to do back in those days; chaos.

6. How does the use of colour and shape contribute to the emotional impact of the painting?

It is a good question for this painting. As much as the artist of this painting wanted to convey the strangeness, the use of colours in this painting makes me feel more strange and wreaks havoc on me. Additionally, there are better combinations than combining these colours that make viewrs feel comfortable, but he did not use them since the its awkwardness would be gone if the better combination has been applied to this painting.

7. How does the use of surreal imagery contribute to the emotional impact of the painting?

They made me think about the real meaning of what he wated to convey to me throughout this painting. It contributes to the painting by making it more confusing and showing unrelated things to the views. The octopus in the middle of the canvas is a typical example. The first time I saw it, I thought it was an octopus. However, the more I have seen this pictur , the more I think about the meaning behind this object. So, surreal imagery contributes to what he wanted to do very well.

8. How does your interpretation of the painting change when you consider the emotional perspective?

As you can see from my answers to the questions, my first interpretation was that this painting looked so strange, and it was hard to catch its real meaning. Nevertheless, after I started to think that he might have wanted to convey his connection between the trees, the orange box, and the octopus, which is convered by the clocks due to the colours, I could have continued on the relationship between the objects and the concept of time. However, when I found that the octopus was his self-portrait, I was sure they are connected to each other since the self-portrait made more sense than the octopus. (How can I thikn it was an octopus?)

9. Does the idea of the painting change when viewd from different perspectives?

No, it does not. The biggest reason for it is that he used his unique way to represent the perspective. So, I do not think his way can create a lot of diverse perspectives.
