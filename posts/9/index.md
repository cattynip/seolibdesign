title: Grade 9
grade: 9
description: I have been a grade 9 student at Bodwell since the last semester was done. As I upgraded my grade, I wanted to write more descriptive expressions and improve my English skill. In this section, I want to record my Desgin Class's activities, not just explain what I have done until now. So you will be able to see the parts ordered by the date.
