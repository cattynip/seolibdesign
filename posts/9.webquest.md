# Web Quest

Create a section on your web page called WebQuest. Using the following web pages find pieces of art that demonstrate the listed perspectives.

1. The Metropolitan Museum of Art: https://www.metmuseum.org
2. The National Gallery of Art: https://www.nga.gov
3. The Museum of Modern Art: https://www.moma.org

For each perspective include:

- The artist's name
- The title of the piece
- The date of the piece
- The medium
- The culture
- How you know what perspective it is
- Describe the emotions/ideas you think the piece is trying to communicate

1. A 1-point perspective:
   ![Classic Landscape](/perspectives/classic-landscape.jpeg)

   - The artist's name: Charles Sheeler American, 1883 ~ 1965
   - The title of the piece: Classic Landscape
   - The date of the piece: 1931
   - The medium: Oil on cnavas
   - The culture: Nowadays manufacturer culture
   - How you know what perspective it is: At a glance, I could recognize that the middle line between the sky and the ground is the horizon of this landscape drawing, and the train rail is one of the lines to the point, distorted. This form is the typical form one-point perspective.
   - Describe the emotions/ideas you think the piece is trying to communicate: Considering that the artist used very bright heavy colours for the bottom of it, which is the ground that the buildings are standing on, I think he wants to convey bright, light, and no-serious emotions. Throughout this interpretation, I want to define that this painting does not have that many meanings or ideas that he wanted to convey in this painting.

2. A 2-point perspective:
   ![Perspective View of a Street](/perspectives/perspective-view-of-a-street.jpeg)

   - The artist's name: Lucas van Doetechum
   - The title of the piece: Perspective View of a Street
   - The date of the piece: 1560
   - The medium: Etching with engraving on laid paper
   - The culture: 16th street
   - How you know what perspective it is: If you remove all elements on the drawing and draw just the outline of the buldings on the right side, you will see four crossed lines and two points. So, it is a two-perspective painting since it is what characteristics a two-point perspective has.
   - Describe the emotions/ideas you think the piece is trying to communicate: This painting wants to convey how the sight, buildings, people and way looked.

3. A 3-point perspective:
   I COULD NOT FIND IT!

4. A point-of-view perspective
   ![Broken Nature](/perspectives/broken-nature.jpeg)

   - The artist's name: NASA
   - The title of the piece: Broken Nature
   - The date of the piece: 2016
   - The medium: The Earth
   - The culture: China
   - How you know what perspective it is: As much as the author said that this photo was taken by a satellite, I could have noticed that this art has a point-of-view perspective. (Because of its characteristic, I thought it was a point of bird's view or something like that. If they did not say it, I would not know it)
   - Describe the emotions/ideas you think the piece is trying to communicate: I firmly believe that NASA wanted to convey the seriousness of broken nature. As you can see in the picture, most areas are red and blue lines crossing throughout the image. Each point and each red and blue stripes and areas represent the seriousness of nature, and it is exactly what NASA wants to convey.

5. A perspective representing 2 emotions
   I COULD NOT FIND IT!

6. A disorienting perspective
   ![Broken Nature](/perspectives/untitled.jpeg)

   - The artist's name: Lee Krasner
   - The title of the piece: Untitled
   - The date of the piece: 1949
   - The medium: Oil on board
   - The culture:
   - How you know what perspective it is: The biggest reason I recognized it as a disorienting perspective was that there are a lot of dark philosophical elements, and no object is focused on. There is no standard and middle of it. Additionally, the overall mood of this painting is chaos and confusion since it does not hint at where I am or what I am doing in the drawing.
   - Describe the emotions/ideas you think the piece is trying to communicate: As much as its perspective is disorienting, it should be treated with confusion, dizziness, or something like that since its overall art technique makes the views feel complicated. And that is also why it is hard to identify what it is trying to communicate.
