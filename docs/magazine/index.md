# Magazine Project

`Magazine Project` is to design and develop a perfect magazine that my client wants to make. For this, I made 3 initial, 2 intermediate and last one final drafts for each section which are the Cover, Middle(Main) and Back pages.

## Cover Page

This section is about the Cover Page of the magazine. The cover page has just one page. Because people can see this part at the first time befor reading them, it is pretty important to hook them and this is also why many cover page of magazines in the market are exaggerated.

## Middle Page

This section is about the Middle Page of the magazine. In the middle part, it is treating what the reporter, writer and creator want to convey. They usually convey using many texts and well-organized paragraphs, sometimes pictures and photographs which are good tools to convey and make the reader keep reading this magazine.

## Back Page

This section is about the Back Page of the magazine. As much as it is end part and the readers can read this part at the end of reading, it usually contains conclusion or resources of the whole magazine. Since it contains conclusions and has chance to hook them, it is as important as the cover page.
